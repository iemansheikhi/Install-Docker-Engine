# Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu

## 1 - Uninstall old versions</h3>

Older versions of Docker were called docker, docker.io, or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them.

```bash
sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

## 2- Install the required packages

### required packages for Docker 
``` bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
```

## 3- Set up the repository

### Add the Docker GPG key and apt repository

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

## 4- Install the Docker Engine

``` bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
```

### Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
``` bash
 sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.
Docker Engine is installed and running.
